## Short Overview

Glosium is a desktop prototype for language learning built with `PySide6`, `Qt WebEngine`, and an HTML/CSS/JavaScript UI. The app lets a learner describe what they want to study, generates vocabulary cards with OpenAI, and then launches a lesson flow based on the selected content.

## Current Capabilities

- Vocabulary card generation through the OpenAI Responses API
- Lesson flow with multiple task types: explanation, matching, translation, filling, and question
- Development fixtures for cards, macro plans, and temporary lesson plans

```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Glebhl/Glosium.git
cd Glosium
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Without `OPENAI_API_KEY`, vocabulary generation will not work.

### 5. Run the app

```bash
python main.py
```

## Status

This project is still an early prototype. The vocabulary setup flow already uses OpenAI, while the full lesson generation pipeline is still partially backed by temporary JSON lesson data.

## Roadmap

Planned next steps include:

- Generate full lessons from the selected vocabulary cards
- Add support for more languages
- Add grammar support
- Add localization other than English
- Replace temporary lesson templates with fully AI-driven lesson creation
- Add progress tracking
